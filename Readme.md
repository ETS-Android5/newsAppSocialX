  
To fetch the data from the newsapi.org i used the volley library:
implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.2.1'

To load the images fetched from the api Picasso is used:
implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'
  
To authenticate the application firebase auth is used so that the user can register in firebase as well as login from google:
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1',
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:20.1.0'

To store the details of registered user firebase database is used:
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:20.0.3'

In order to save the time i used the counter code picker library:
implementation 'com.hbb20:ccp:2.4.7'
